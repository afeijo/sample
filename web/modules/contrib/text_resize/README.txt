Description
-------
The Text Resize module creates a block with links that use
jQuery to resize text within the specified div.

Text Resize was originally written by Mark W. Jarrell (attheshow) at
Fleet Thought (http://fleetthought.com). Thanks to pallavi_sugandhi for starting
the D8 port.


Install
-------
Installing the Text Resize module is simple:

1) Copy the text_resize folder to the modules folder in your installation

2) Enable the module using Administer -> Extend page (/admin/modules)

3) Configure the block to work with your theme at Configuration -> Text Resize

4) Place the block into a region at Structure -> Block Layout


Customization
-------

Text Resize should work fine with the Bartik, Garland or Zen-based themes.
If it's not working for your installation, you may need to change the div that's
being resized. Please use the administration form for Text Resize to customize.
More customization tips can be found in the help for the module.
You'll find the help at /admin/help/text_resize.

Support
-------
If you experience a problem with the module, file a
request or issue on the Text Resize queue. DO NOT POST IN THE FORUMS. Posting in
the issue queues is a direct line of communication with the module author.
